# calculator
A simple web calculator. Done as part of the The Odin Project Curriculum to practice HTML, CSS and mainly Javascript skills

There is a separate branch called long-string, in which the calculator can work with long operations
including multiple operators

What I learned:
- Checking if input from the user is a number or not
- Working with various string and array methods
- Using the debugger to understand why code doesn't work in the intended way
